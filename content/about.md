We are a team of two people ['Karan', 'Allwyn'] trying to understand our massive country 'India' using data and numbers. This site documents our efforts towards that goal.

```
authors = ['Karan', 'Allwyn']
```

We will be posting about:
1. How to scrape, wrangle and make sense of data.
2. Visualising data. 


You can contact us indianama [at] example.com for:

- :thought_balloon: ideas
- :+1: appreciation 
- :-1: criticism
- :wave: just to say hi.
